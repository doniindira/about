## üöÄ About Me

I'm a **Software Developer** ‚ù§Ô∏è passionate about creating innovative solutions and learning new technologies through hands-on experience.

- üåç Born in Jakarta, grew up in Long Iram sub-district, Kutai Barat district, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia üáÆüá©
- üíª Started my programming journey with **C/C++** and **QT Designer** for desktop applications
- üåê Transitioned to web development with **CodeIgniter**, then discovered **Laravel**
- üì± Explored **Flutter** before settling on **React Native** for mobile development

My coding journey began differently than most - instead of starting with web basics, I dove into systems programming with C and C++ for university projects. This foundation gave me a solid understanding of programming fundamentals before I ventured into web and mobile development.
